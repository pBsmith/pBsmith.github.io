                    <p>
                        I am currently a Junior at Rollins College studying Computer Science. I'm interested in most things 
                        related to Information Technology with an emphasis on cyber security. 
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        I have completed courses in Object Orientated Design, Problem Solving with Java, Operating Systems, 
                        Database Design and Development, Simulation Design and Development, and Networks. I have experience 
                        working with Java, C, Python, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I am looking to continue my education and gain professional experience working in the 
                        Information Technology industry.

                                A widget is a simple application extension that is often part of a larger application already 
                                installed on the device. However, if you really think about it a widget is simply a cooler name
                                for a project, which is why I will be referring to all my projects as widgets.

                                The Christmas Card Generator is a web application utilizing Node and Express. The application allows users to scroll
                                through a gallery of Christmas themed images and select their favorite. Once the image is selected it will populate
                                an area on the page. From there the users can input text on the bottom and top of the image. After the user has made
                                their alterations to the image, they can then download their card as a .png file. Thus, generating their own Christmas
                                Card.

                                She Sells C Shells The Terminal is an implementation of a <i>shell</i>. The shell displays a prompt where the 
                                user types commands. After each command is entered, the shell creates a child process to execute the requested
                                program, then prompts for another command once the child process has finished. This widget uses some of the 
                                standard commands for working with processes such as <strong>fork</strong> and <strong>execvp</strong>.

                                The Meme Clicker Game is a web application utilizing Node and Express. The application allows users to click
                                hilarious memes to death.

                                Upon running the application the user is presented with an image of a meme and the 
                                meme's health bar. The user must click the meme until the health bar reaches 0, thus killing the meme and 
                                generating a new meme. User's gain coins when a meme is killed, which they can use to purchase "Meme Killer
                                Helpers." These helpers boost the user's attack when purchased. Once the user has killed a specific number of memes
                                they level up. Leveling up increases the memes' health, which is why those helpers come in handy.
